## Theme Options - Customizer

The Customizer allows you to preview changes to your site before publishing them. 

### Site Identity
* Site Title and Description - change / show / hide
* Logo - Upload image for site logo
* Site Icon (used as a browser and app icon)

### Layout 
* Global Layout (2 columns - sidebar / content, 2 columns - content / sidebar, 1 column content).  
   You can override this per page/post basis.
* Header Layout - Select layout for header elements (branding and main navigation).  
   Stacked: left aligned, right aligned, centered.  
   Inline: logo->menu, menu->logo.
* Footer Widgets - Choose the number of widget columns in the footer widget area.  
Each column can have any number of widgets.

### Menus
This panel is used for managing navigation menus for content you have already published on your site. You can create menus and add items for existing content such as pages, posts, categories, tags, formats, or custom links. Menus can be displayed in locations defined by your theme or in widget areas by adding a “Custom Menu” widget.  

**Locations:** This theme uses wp_nav_menu() in three locations. Primary, Mobile and Footer.  
 
* **Primary** is for the Main site navigation, it's unavailable on mobile devices.   
* **Mobile** is for Responsive Mobile Menu, shown on mobile devices, instead of Primary. You may want to create another menu for Mobile location, or you can add the same one you added in the Primary location.   
* **Footer** location is placed in the right footer. You can use it as a regular menu or as a Social Links menu. If you add custom links to your social networks, the menu items will be presented with coresponding icon (isons are provided by Ionicons icon font). Textual part of the link will be visually hidden, but still available for screen readers.  

### Base Settings
- **Base Typography** - Font Family, text and links color. **Default Font Family is Roboto**
- **Typography Size - Modular Scale** - A modular scale is a sequence of numbers that relate to one another in a meaningful way. You can set different base font and different modular scale for desktop, tablets and mobile screens.  
	This theme provides four scales, Major Second, Minor Third, Major Third and Perfect Fourth.
